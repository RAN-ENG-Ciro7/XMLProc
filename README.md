# XMLProc
Processing of Nokia 2G and 3G XML configuration files 

XMLProc is a Python code to extract customized network configuration, in Excel table format, from the XML configuration file in Nokia OSS (Netact).

An HTML interface is provided for the user to provide the file to be decoded and setup the desired configuration.

Several ways of information retrieve are allowed:
- Extract all the information (objects and parameters) from the XML.
- Extract only specific types of objects.
- Specify the information to extract by a json file (predefined or user-provided)
